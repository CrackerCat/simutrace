%description
Simutrace is a tracing framework for full system simulators and has been 
conceived with full length, no-loss tracing of high-frequency events such as 
executed CPU instructions and main memory references in mind.
 
The framework places no restriction on the type and number of captured events 
and employs a scalable storage format, which easily handles traces of hundreds 
of gigabytes in size. Simutrace has been particularly extended to facilitate 
efficient memory tracing by incorporating aggressive, but fast memory trace 
compression.
 
Simutrace is a research project of the operating systems group at 
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
