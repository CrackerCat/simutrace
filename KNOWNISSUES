Following is a list of issues we are aware of, but did not have had any time 
to fix, yet. We are looking into fixing these issues in future releases.

+ In rare cases the server may enter a state in which it stops processing 
  (read/write) data from a memory stream, that is a stream which uses the 
  built-in memory trace compressor. The server will usually timeout while 
  waiting for resources to perform the desired operation. The problem surfaces,
  when the configured resource limits (memory, number of worker threads) are 
  not sufficient to process the sequence (and rate) of incoming calls.
  Increasing the resource limits or reducing the read/write rate of the client
  usually avoids the problem.

+ The server may crash if an open store is located on a network share and the
  connection to the share is lost. The crash is caused by not handling page-in
  (SIGBUS) exceptions when reading or writing memory-mapped parts of the store.
  Placing the store on a local device avoids the problem.
